        <h2>Abstract / Introduction</h2>
      
        <!-- Focused Work Introduction -->
        <p>
          <strong>Introduction:</strong> In Summer 2025, I worked as a Software Support / Business Systems Analyst Co-op
          with the City of Brampton’s <strong>Recreation Division</strong>. This website highlights the automation projects,
          documentation, and process improvements I created to make the recreation system more efficient. I hope readers
          come away understanding not just what I built — Python Selenium scripts, workflow documentation, and audits —
          but also how these contributions reduced manual work, improved data quality, and made a lasting impact on the
          team.
        </p>
      
        <!-- Your existing abstract content stays here -->
        <p>
          During my co-op term at the City of Brampton, I spearheaded QA automation projects and operational
          improvements that directly reduced manual work and improved data accuracy. I developed Selenium scripts to
          validate resident accounts, created a coverage estimator to measure test completeness, and authored SOPs
          with screenshots for future staff. These efforts led to measurable time savings — reducing residency
          validation from <strong>~20 seconds to ~7 seconds per account</strong> — across thousands of records.

    <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
    <p>
      The City of Brampton’s Transit & Recreation division serves a large and diverse population, managing
      memberships, program registrations, and facility bookings through the <strong>PerfectMind/Xplor</strong> platform.
      The recreation system itself is <strong>outsourced to Xplor</strong>, meaning the City collaborates closely with an external vendor
      for updates, maintenance, and issue resolution. This partnership requires clear communication and thorough
      testing before rolling out changes to avoid service disruptions for residents.

    </div>
  
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Insight:</strong> Working with an outsourced system taught me the importance of vendor coordination,
      reproducible bug reports, and automation evidence that can be shared externally — making my work useful
      not just for internal QA but also for Xplor’s support team when diagnosing issues.

    <h2>Job Description & Key Projects</h2>
    <p>
      My co-op role combined technical automation, documentation, and cross-team collaboration.
      The most unique aspect of my job was building and running real automation scripts in a
      live municipal system environment, while also helping shape processes that future staff
      will use. I applied programming skills from school but also learned many practical
      techniques on the job — especially around debugging, workflow design, and team
      communication. The C programming labguage is mainly taught at the Univeristy of Guelph so I became more proficient at python on my co-op term.
    </p>
  
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Automation Development:</strong>
        Wrote Python Selenium scripts using XML locators and occasional JavaScript execution to handle complex
        UI interactions. Added logging, CSV output, and screenshots for a reliable audit trail.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Python (classroom + practice), Selenium/WebDriver (learned on the job), DOM inspection.
      </div>
  
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Workflow Documentation:</strong>
        Authored clear SOPs and visual guides for running scripts, validating results, and troubleshooting.
        This ensured the automations could be maintained after my term ended.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Technical writing (on the job), process mapping (learned from colleagues).
      </div>
  
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Inbox & Support Management:</strong>
        Managed the shared support inbox, responded to resident issues, and escalated problems to the vendor
        when necessary — giving me experience in customer service and communication.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Professional communication (on the job), prioritization, escalation protocols.
      </div>
  
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Audits & Reporting:</strong>
        Conducted data audits, summarized results, and presented findings during weekly reviews, helping
        decision-makers understand trends and gaps.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Data analysis (class + job), Excel/CSV handling, stakeholder presentation.
      </div>
  
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Accounting Collaboration:</strong>
        Worked with the accounting team to understand invoice processing workflows and suggested an OCR-based
        automation script that could capture and process invoice data automatically.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Workflow analysis, solution design, automation planning (learned on the job).

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      This term significantly improved my ability to combine automation engineering with business systems analysis.
      I learned to measure the impact of my work with metrics, communicate results visually, and deliver tools
      others can use after my term ends. These skills will serve me well in QA automation, DevOps, or process
      improvement roles in future co-ops.

    <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
    <p>
      I am extremely grateful to my manager <strong>Phebe</strong> for her guidance and mentorship throughout the term.
      She made the workplace welcoming, was always approachable, and taught me valuable lessons about collaboration,
      communication, and working effectively with others — which made this co-op a very positive experience.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I also had the chance to work closely with several colleagues, each helping me grow in different areas:
