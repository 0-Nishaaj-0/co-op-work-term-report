    <h2>Abstract / Introduction</h2>
  
    <!-- Focused Work Introduction -->
    <p>
      <strong>Introduction:</strong> In Summer 2025, I worked as a Software Support / Business Systems Analyst Co-op
      with the City of Brampton’s <strong>Recreation Division</strong>. This website highlights the automation projects,
      documentation, and process improvements I created to make the recreation system more efficient. I hope readers
      come away understanding not just what I built — Python Selenium scripts, workflow documentation, and audits —
      but also how these contributions reduced manual work, improved data quality, and made a lasting impact on the
      team.

    <p>
      During my co-op term at the City of Brampton, I spearheaded QA automation projects and operational
      improvements that directly reduced manual work and improved data accuracy. I developed Selenium scripts to
      validate resident accounts, created a coverage estimator to measure test completeness, and authored SOPs
      with screenshots for future staff. These efforts led to measurable time savings — reducing residency
      validation from <strong>~20 seconds to ~7 seconds per account</strong> — across thousands of records.

    <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
    <p>
      The City of Brampton’s Transit & Recreation division serves a large and diverse population, managing
      memberships, program registrations, and facility bookings through the <strong>PerfectMind/Xplor</strong> platform.
      The recreation system itself is <strong>outsourced to Xplor</strong>, meaning the City collaborates closely with an external vendor
      for updates, maintenance, and issue resolution. This partnership requires clear communication and thorough
      testing before rolling out changes to avoid service disruptions for residents.
    </p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Insight:</strong> Working with an outsourced system taught me the importance of vendor coordination,
      reproducible bug reports, and automation evidence that can be shared externally — making my work useful
      not just for internal QA but also for Xplor’s support team when diagnosing issues.

  <h2>Goals and Learning Outcomes</h2>

  <!-- This short intro explicitly answers "What were your goals/learning outcomes?" -->
  <p>
    My goals for this work term were to build reliable automation, document repeatable workflows,
    support residents and staff through clear communication, and identify new opportunities for efficiency.
    I also aimed to grow soft skills around teamwork and cross-department collaboration.
  </p>

  <div class="goals-grid">
    <!-- Planned Goals (covers: job-task goals, skills to learn, tech to use + why) -->
    <div class="goal-card">
      <h3>Planned Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <!-- Job-task goals -->
        <li><strong>Job-task goals:</strong> Automate high-volume Recreation tasks (account validation, checks) and produce
          <strong>workflow documentation/SOPs</strong> so others can run the same steps reliably.</li>

        <!-- Skills to learn & benefit -->
        <li><strong>Skills to learn (benefit):</strong> 
          Python Selenium with <strong>XML locators</strong> and targeted JavaScript execution (to handle tricky elements),
          structured logging/screenshots for <strong>audits</strong>, and inbox triage/prioritization.
          These skills help me contribute faster on future QA automation and support teams.</li>

        <!-- Technologies & why -->
        <li><strong>Technologies & why:</strong> 
          <em>Python + Selenium/WebDriver</em> (widely used, fast iteration), 
          <em>CSV/Excel → dashboards</em> (to show impact to stakeholders), and exploration of <em>OCR</em> for invoice processing
          (to reduce manual data entry for Accounting).</li>

        <!-- Soft goals -->
        <li><strong>Soft goals:</strong> Improve teamwork and communication (daily inbox updates, status notes),
          learn to write maintainable SOPs, and practice concise updates in weekly reviews.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Reflections & Results (covers: completed vs not, and why) -->
    <div class="goal-card">
      <h3>Reflections & Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Completed:</strong> Built and ran <strong>Python Selenium</strong> scripts using XML locators; added logging to CSV and
          screenshots for a clear audit trail; reduced per-account checks from ~20s to ~7s.</li>
        <li><strong>Completed:</strong> Wrote <strong>workflow documentation/SOPs</strong> so others could reproduce results; created simple
          dashboards from CSV/Excel to communicate time savings and error trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Completed:</strong> Managed the shared <strong>support inbox</strong>, reproduced issues, escalated to the vendor when needed,
          and closed tickets with clear notes for the team.</li>
        <li><strong>Partially completed:</strong> <strong>Accounting invoice automation (OCR)</strong> — I analyzed the workflow and proposed
          an approach (OCR + parsing + validation) but full implementation wasn’t shipped due to timeline and
          access constraints. I left a documented plan for future development.</li>
        <li><strong>Soft skills growth:</strong> Worked closely with Phebe (manager) and teammates; improved teamwork, communication,
          and cross-department coordination (QA ↔ Accounting ↔ Vendor).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Explicit Q&A callout to satisfy the rubric prompts -->

    <h2>Job Description & Key Projects</h2>
    <p>
      My co-op role combined technical automation, documentation, and cross-team collaboration.
      The most unique aspect of my job was building and running real automation scripts in a
      live municipal system environment, while also helping shape processes that future staff
      will use. I applied programming skills from school but also learned many practical
      techniques on the job — especially around debugging, workflow design, and team
      communication. The C programming labguage is mainly taught at the Univeristy of Guelph so I became more proficient at python on my co-op term.
    </p>
  
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Automation Development:</strong>
        Wrote Python Selenium scripts using XML locators and occasional JavaScript execution to handle complex
        UI interactions. Added logging, CSV output, and screenshots for a reliable audit trail.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Python (classroom + practice), Selenium/WebDriver (learned on the job), DOM inspection.
      </div>
  
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Workflow Documentation:</strong>
        Authored clear SOPs and visual guides for running scripts, validating results, and troubleshooting.
        This ensured the automations could be maintained after my term ended.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Technical writing (on the job), process mapping (learned from colleagues).
      </div>
  
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Inbox & Support Management:</strong>
        Managed the shared support inbox, responded to resident issues, and escalated problems to the vendor
        when necessary — giving me experience in customer service and communication.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Professional communication (on the job), prioritization, escalation protocols.
      </div>

        Conducted data audits, summarized results, and presented findings during weekly reviews, helping
        decision-makers understand trends and gaps.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Data analysis (class + job), Excel/CSV handling, stakeholder presentation.
      </div>
  
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Accounting Collaboration:</strong>
        Worked with the accounting team to understand invoice processing workflows and suggested an OCR-based
        automation script that could capture and process invoice data automatically.  
        <em>Skills:</em> Workflow analysis, solution design, automation planning (learned on the job).
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  

<section class="section">
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    This term significantly improved my ability to combine automation engineering with business systems analysis.
    I learned to measure the impact of my work with metrics, communicate results visually, and deliver tools
    others can use after my term ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    These skills will directly benefit me in my next co-op at <strong>McKesson Canada</strong>, where I will be
    working in a software development and QA automation environment. My experience with
    <strong>Python Selenium scripting, documentation, and cross-team collaboration</strong> will allow me to
    contribute to McKesson's automated testing pipelines and communicate results effectively in a
    large-scale enterprise setting.
